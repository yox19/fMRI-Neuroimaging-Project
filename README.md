# Functional connectivity changes Following Post-Stroke Rehabilitation

# Overview
This project explores resting-state functional connectivity changes before and after stroke rehabilitation using an atlas-based ROI approach. The analysis focuses on motor-related cortical regions to assess network-level changes associated with recovery.

The project is intended as a methodological demonstration and exploratory analysis, not a definitive clinical inference. 
# Dataset
-Source: OpenNeuro (ds003999)
-Subjects: 5
-Sessions: Pre-rehabilitation and Post-rehabilitation
-Modality: Resting-state fMRI
# Methods
Preprocessing: Preprocessed resting-state fMRI scans, with motion correction and spatial normalization already applied.
ROI Definition: 
Atlas: Harvard–Oxford Cortical Atlas (2mm)
Motor ROIs selected based on anatomical labels:
-Precentral gyrus
-Postcentral gyrus
-Supplementary Motor Area
Connectivity Analysis:
-Time series extraction: NiftiLabelsMasker
-Standardization: z-score (sample-wise)
-Connectivity metric: Pearson correlation
-Connectivity matrices computed per subject
-Mean connectivity computed separately for pre and post sessions
# Visualizations
-Connectivity matrices
-Glass brain projection of connectivity change
-Network-level motor connectivity visualization
# Results (Exploratory)
-Mean motor network connectivity increased post-rehabilitation
-Average within-motor connectivity change: ~0.09 (correlation units)

These findings are descriptive and intended to illustrate connectivity analysis workflows rather than establish statistical significance.
# Limitations
- Small sample size (n=5) limits statistical power
- No specific rehabilitation protocol examined
- Study characteristics could affect statistical output
- Length of rehabilitation not clearly stated
# Future Directions
-Subject-level statistical testing
-Inclusion of motion and physiological confounds
-Larger participant cohort to validate findings
-Longitudinal tracking to assess persistence of changes
-Correlation with clinical outcome measures and Comparison across different rehabilitation approaches
# Technologies
-Python
